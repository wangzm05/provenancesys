This package contains the classes for reading and writing extension
elements for BPEL.  Any element outside of the default BPEL (1.1)
namespace is assumed to be an extension element.
<br />
The IAeExtensionElement interface provides the minimum amount
of common information likely to be shared by all readers and
writers.  It is assumed that custom readers/writers that
are registered to handle specific extension elements will cast
the generic interface to the appropriate impl.
<br />
A default reader/writer class is provided to handle all
extension elements.
