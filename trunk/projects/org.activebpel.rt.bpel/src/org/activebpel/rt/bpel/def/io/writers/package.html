This package provides the impl classes for the 
IAeBpelWriter interface.
<br />
The writer class uses a AeDefTraverser to traverse the AeProcess
object model.  A custom depth first traverser (AeInvokeWithScopeTraverser) is
used to provide special case behavior for traversing an invoke
activity with an implicit scope.
<br />
The traverser is used by a AeAbstractDefVisitor subclass that
is responsible for looking up each writer and processing accordingly.
