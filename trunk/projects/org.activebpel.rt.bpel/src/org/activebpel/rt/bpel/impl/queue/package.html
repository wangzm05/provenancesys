Contains classes that model inbound and outbound messages from the engine as well as 
alarms. They are used in conjunction with the IAeQueueManager in order to track which 
processes are waiting for data, where data inbound to the engine should go, who to notify 
when an alarm completes, and what objects are waiting to get replies from a message.
