
About the B4P Inbox Rendering SDK


A custom inbox uses the BPEL for People Inbox rendering SDK to replace the basic 
ActiveBPEL Task Detail Work Item tab with your own custom solution. 
You can also replace the entire Task Details page with your own page. 

The SDK contains the following items:

* Default schemas and XSLs for the ActiveBPEL Inbox. You can modify the XSLs based 
  on the schemas. 
* Sample customized XSL files, input documents, and parameter files 
* A mirror image of the Inbox application useful as a testing environment 


For details on using this SDK, refer to the BPEL for People online help in 
ActiveBPEL Designer. Look up the topic entitled "Creating a Custom Inbox."
