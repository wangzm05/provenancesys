This package contains classes which support BPEL validation.
The main class is AeDefValidationVisitor, which is based on our definition
visitor interface.  It visits all the definition objects and verifies
them as being bpel compliant as well as checking that all internal
and external references can be resolved.  The IAeErrorreporter class
is supplied by callers so they can create customized erorr handlers for logging, etc.
