This package contains the registry classes for accessing 
readers and writers for BPEL and extension elements.
<br />
The IAeBpelRegistry provides access to all of the readers and
writers associated with standard BPEL (1.1) elements.  Readers
are accessed by providing the class of the parent AeBaseDef object
and the QName of the current element.  This allows different 
readers to mapped to elements with the same QName but different
parent classes.  Writers follow the same pattern.
<br />
NOTE: In the current impl, the writer parent class is ignored as
there are no custom writers based on parent class differences.
Also, the interfaces do not expose any way to register custom
readers/writers at runtime - custom registry classes should be
provided.
<br />
The IAeExtensionRegistry provides programmatic access for 
registering custom extension readers/writers.  By default,
the registry has a default reader/writer installed to handle
all extension elements in a generic fashion.
